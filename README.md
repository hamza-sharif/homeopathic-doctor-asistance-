# Project Structure

This project consists of a front-end and a back-end application. Below is the recommended directory structure:

### Front-end

- The front-end directory contains all necessary files to build and run the client-side application.
- It includes a `Dockerfile` that defines how to build the front-end application.

### Back-end

- The back-end directory contains all necessary files for the server-side application.
- It includes a separate `Dockerfile` for building the back-end application.

### Docker Compose

- A `docker-compose.yml` file is located at the root of the project to manage both services.
- This configuration allows for easy orchestration of the front-end and back-end applications.
